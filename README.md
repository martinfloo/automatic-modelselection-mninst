# automatic-modelselection-mninst

This project was a part of my uni course on machine learning. Our task was to suggest at least three models to be used as digit reckognizers and automaticly choose the best on in a ML pipeline. 

I did this project in collabroation with my friend Braghe. 

The dataset given isn't available any longer, but it was very similar to MNIST with around 100k samples to train and test on. A link to MNIST will be given below.

A similar PDF version of the notebook will be added as the plotly plots din't show up in the github rendered notebook.
